# Travel Club Website

This website was built with HTML, CSS and a little bit of jquery.

I'm still trying to figure out how to use media queries correctly, so if you see something that's not right please let me know! <br>
I'm open to all feedback :smirk:

I also experimented with CSS variables - also open to feedback :smiley:

<li>Google Fonts - Nunito Sans</li>
<li>Css-clip-path-generator</li>
<li>Unsplash</li><br>

<strong>Custom made color pallette that I made for this project:</strong>
